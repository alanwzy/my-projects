To run 39_ass2_impl following libraries need to be installed by following codes:

# import libraries
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("ROSE")

Please have the csv files and the notebook in the same folder.

There are four sections 
1. The first section reads train and test data into notebook.
2. The second section train classifiers for each of the appliances.
3. The third section produces predictions on test data.
4. The fourth section outputs the predictions to csv in correct format.

The tuning of parameters are already done. There should be no problem to run all the codes after the packages are installed.
