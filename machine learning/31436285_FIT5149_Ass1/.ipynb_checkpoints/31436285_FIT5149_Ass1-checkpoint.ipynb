It will be hard to build a accurate linear model based on the eight variables given, there might be potiential non-linear relationships between some of the predictors and our target variable, non-linear models may be required for a better performance measurements.\n",

However, for some unknown reason, the cube root transformations in the model leads to NaN in predictions.

As GAMs allow a non-linear fit to the variables, due to the fact that the predictors does not show a strong linear relationship with the rotor temperature, this non-linear approach performs better than linear regression model. Using a GAM model also saves times for manually trying out different transformations on each variable individually. The performance measurements supports GAM as the best model so far, a high RMSE indicates a high prediction accuracy, a low AIC compare to other models meaning the GAM model is relatively less complex, thus the model size is smaller with eight variables included and 5 pairs of intersections."

    "Overall, in the development of modelling rotor temperature, the result shows all eight original variables should be included in our final model. Although the correlations of the predictors and rotor temperature are low and does not appear to have a linear relationship on scatter plots. These predictors can still be modelled by smoothed non-linear function and used to predict rotor temperature to some extent. In our best model GAM, the p values of all eight variables are significant at level 0.001, means all eight variables are significant to the prediction of rotor temperature. Apart from that, five intersections are also included in the model, as they are pairs of variables with high correlation, which also have p values less than 0.001. Cube root transformation of q component of voltage has found to be strongly helpful in the modelling process, however causes unknown errors in prediction process thus can not be used in models. \n",

Also, compare to other models such as randomforest trees, GAM is more easy to implement in real world. Thus, the GAM model is most suitable in this case as it  statisfied three requirements of:small model sizes, high prediction accuracy and lightweight implementation."
