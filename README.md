<!-- PROJECTS OVERVIEW-->
## Project Overviews
* Project Umbrella : 
  * A website for social good developed by team lemon lemonades using .NET, Azure, python, html, java etc. 
  * The purpose of the website is to protect our future generation from the danger of UV radiation. 
  * The project intends to raise children and parents' awearness of sun safety to protect skin & eye health of children start from an early age.
<br></br>

* Residential Energy Appliance Classification
  * The aim of the project is to develop multiple classifers for each individual target appliance that can detect whether target appliances are being used in each time interval (e.g. 1-minute interval) as correctly as possible.
  * Multiple classifiers for each individual target appliance are developed with decision tree, SVM, natural network models
  * Applied in-depth analysis on data and features, use feature selection, subset methods to optimize training results of the models. 
<br></br>

* Electric Rotor Temperature Prediction
  * The main purpose of this project is to be able to model the rotor temperatures of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) in real-time.
  * Developed and evaluate the models with appreciate performance measurements , interpret the results and select the best model with a high performance in prediction the temperature.
  * Applied decision trees, regression models, L1&L2 regularization, step-wise selection and generalized models.
<br></br>

* Data wrangling projects
  * For this project, the task is to analyze the dataset, find and fix the problems in the data, perform data cleaning and wrangling. 
  * Conducted In-depth analyze of the dataset, interpreted, fixed the incorrect values and well computed the missing values.
  * Applied pandas, nltk, sklearn, mathplotlib packages.
<br></br>

* Covid-19 Visualization
  * 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a coronavirus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first officially been detected in Wuhan, China. While coronavirus continues to spread over the world, China the first country that encountered the virus have successfully contained the outbreak. 
  * In this project, I have created R shiny app for interactive visualization of covid-19 statistics world wide to investigate the effect of this event on different countries. 
<br></br>

* Australia Coral bleaching visualization
  * Coral bleaching has been a serious issue in Australia over the years.
  * The project aims to analyse the coral bleaching in Australia by location and type. 
  * Tableau is used to visualize of geographic data on map to investigate the issue.
