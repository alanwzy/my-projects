                            <p>UV radiation causes both temporary and chronic eye damages when our eyes are exposed to it frequently. When the UV level is 3 or above, the Cancer Council suggests wearing sunglasses at all times. During the summer in Australia, all regions of the nation are exposed to UV levels of 3 or higher for lengthy periods of time during the day. When the sun is low in the sky, our eyes are exposed to UV radiation directly. On the other hand, reflected and scattered light also have a strong impact and increase the total UV radiation that is exposed to our eyes.</p>

                            <p>1. Always put a pair of sunglasses in your children’s bag, so they can put on when needed.</p>
                            <p>2. Choose a close-fitting, wrap-around style of sunglasses for your children.</p>
                            <p>3. Choose category 2 or higher glasses for your children as lenses with category above 2 can absorb more than 95% of UV radiation and provide a good protection for your children.</p>
                            <p>4. Do not use toy sunglasses for your children, as they do not meet the sun protection requirements under the Australian Standard.</p>
                            <p>5. Choose sunglasses that have soft elastic to keep the glasses in place. Also, choose a style that is safe for children to use, e.g. make sure the arms of glasses don't become a safety hazard.</p>
                            <p>6. If your children don’t want to wear sunglasses, put on a suitable hat can still help protect their eyes from the damage of UV radiation.</p>
