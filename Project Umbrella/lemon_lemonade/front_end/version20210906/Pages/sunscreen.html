                                Sunscreen is a photoprotective topical product for the skin that absorbs or reflects some of the sun's ultraviolet (UV)
                                radiation and thus helps protect against sunburn and most importantly prevent skin cancer.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To get the best protection from your sunscreen, apply it liberally and frequently.
                                In addition, you also need to slip on a shirt, slap on a hat, seek out shade and slide on some sunnies.

                                There are a variety of sunscreens that can be applied on,
                                depending on the UV level of a given day, we should choose the
                                correct sunscreen to protect us and our children.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>What is SPF? (Sun Protection Factor):</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                SPF is a measure of the amount of protection sunscreen can give against UVB radiation.
                                It tells you how much time a person can be exposed to the sun before getting burned compared to no sunscreen.
                                E.g. Applying SPF50 means it takes 50 times longer to get sunburned compared to no sunscreen applied.
                            </p>

                            <p class="note note-light">
                                <strong>Note:</strong>
                                Sunscreen with different SPF can block different percentage of UV: <br>
                                - SPF 4: 75% <br>
                                - SPF 8: 87.5% <br>
                                - SPF 15: 93.3% <br>
                                - SPF 30: 96.7% <br>
                                - SPF 50: 98% <br>
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Broad-spectrum:</strong></p>


                            <p>
                                UV radiation comes in two forms, UVA and UVB rays. Tannin and premature ageing are caused by UVA radiation,
                                but sunburn and skin cancer are caused by UVB rays. A broad-spectrum sunscreen can shield you and your children from both types of dangerous radiation.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Water-resistant sunscreen:</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                When your children are having outdoor activities involving swimming or perspiring heavily, water-resistant sunscreens should be applied to their skin.
                                As water-resistant sunscreens have been proven to be effective at protecting our skin in water for up to 40 minutes of swimming.
                            </p>

                                <li>Choose a sunscreen that your child feels comfortable with and is easy to apply.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Try spray: Sprays are easy to apply on children. Spray a generous and even coating on skin.
                                    Don't spray near the face or mouth to avoid inhalation of the product.
                                    Also, remember to check the direction of the wind before spraying on your children.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Apply early and reapply: Sunscreen needs to be applied beforehand,
                                    about 20 minutes before your children go outside and reapply consistently.
                                    Also remember to reapply after swimming or excessive sweating.
                                </li>
                                <li>Let your children practise applying sunscreen by themselves so that they can adopt the skills and habits at an early stage and reapply the sunscreen during the activities.</li>
                                <li>Keep the sunscreen in a cool place on your children’s belongings so It will be cold when applying – especially refreshing on a hot, summer’s day.</li>
                                <li>Try a clip-on sunscreen that can hang from your child’s bag and act as a visual reminder.</li>
                                <li>Demonstrate it to your children – children learn best from their parents. Apply sunscreen together with your children so that they can watch how you do it and follow your example.</li>
